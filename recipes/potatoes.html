<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Introducing your new favourite potato recipe – buttery, 
    crispy SMASHED POTATOES! Crazy crispy on the outside and 
    fluffy on the inside, there’s a serious risk that only half of these
    will make it to the dinner table…</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 12 to 14 small potatoes</li>
    <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>Finely chopped parsley</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
    <li>Cook potatoes: Bring a pot of water to the boil, add 1 tbsp salt. Cook potatoes until soft - small ones should take around 20 to 25 minutes, medium ones might take 30 minutes. It's ok if the skin splits. Alternatively, steam or microwave them.
    Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). </li>

   <li> Steam dry: Drain the potatoes and let them dry in the colander for 5 minutes or so.</li>

    <li>Smash! Place on the tray then use a large fork or potato masher to squish them, keeping them in one piece. Thin = crisper. Thicker = fluffier insides. (Both good!) More nubbly surface = better crunch!</li>
    
    <li>Steam dry again: Leave on the tray to steam dry for 5 minutes or so - makes them crispier!</li>
    
   <li> Drizzle: Drizzle with butter, then olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
    
   <li> Bake: Bake for 45 minutesor until deep golden and crispy. Do not flip!</li>
    
    <li>Serve hot, sprinkled with parsley if desired.</li>
</ol>
